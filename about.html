            <p>I'm a second-year graduate student (Master of Integrated Product Design) at the University of Pennsylvania and recently received my Bachelor of Arts in Architecture from Penn in May. I am passionate about creating products and experiences that generate conversations, connection, and that feeling of being seen and heard.</p>
            <p>This stems from my work as an advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion. I hold a couple of DEIA positions within the performing arts space, and it has become my most impactful and favorite contribution on campus. It has taught me how to be more empathetic, have difficult conversations, address problems head-on, and be an active listener. While these roles came with their challenges, I am grateful for the way they allowed me to recognize that one of my core values and what drives me is creating equitable, accessible, and inclusive systems and processes that increase diversity and the sense of belonging.</p>
            <p>I hope to bring this perspective into my future work and I am interested in combining my DEIA experience with my interests in inclusive design, sustainability, and social impact entrepreneurship.</p> 
            <p>Special shoutout to my family. Without their sacrifices and resilience, I would not be who or where I am. I am a proud mix of my mom's strength, my dad's work ethic, and my older brother's vision to uplift our community. Thank you.</p>
